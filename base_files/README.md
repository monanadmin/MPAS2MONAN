# **MONAN - Model for Ocean-laNd-Atmosphere redictioN**

MONAN is a community model of the Unified Earth System that has as its main objective, as its name already refers, to be a numerical model that covers all scales, geographical and temporal, of the entire Earth system and its implications. It is "community" because it aggregates efforts from several brazilian national institutions such as universities, research centers, operational centers and various authorities in the area of meteorology, environment, oceans and others. It also can receive support from international centers and universities as well as support from the private sector.

MONAN is based from a fork of MPAS, The Model for Prediction Across Scales. You can find MPAS in https://github.com/MPAS-Dev/MPAS-Model
